- **Real-time Alert Triage**: Uses AI to categorize and prioritize alerts.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns indicating potential threats.
- **Proactive Insights and Minimized False Positives**: Provides actionable insights and reduces noise in alert systems.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Simulation**: Utilizes [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range).
- **AI Model**: Employs Qdrant vector database, Cohere APIs for embeddings, and Gemini for summarization.
- **Backend & Frontend**: Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the server: `python app.py`

## Data and Training
